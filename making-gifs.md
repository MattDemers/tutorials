#Making GIFs with Photoshop

Making GIFs is currently becoming one of the most important things in my toolkit, mostly because they make tweets look better and furnish articles well. However, you need to be careful of both size and content in order to meet space requirements, as the file format is inherently large due to its age and poor optimization.

This can be worked around in certain stages, but sadly people haven't phased GIFs out entirely due to a couple reasons (by my thoughts, at least):

1. They auto-play on Twitter instead of requiring a user to click through. They also play on hover for other services (Tumblr, Facebook, etc)
2. They are accepted by many older services, especially ones that don't accept embedding your own HTML (like Pinterest)
3. GIFV, GFYs and .WebMs have yet to come up with a format that works for everyone

It sounds silly, but even putting one button for people to click (like playing a video or .WebM) might be enough for people *not* to click on it. Sadly, that's how content works sometimes.

#This Guide Requires:

* Photoshop
* Mild video editing

The reason we're using Photoshop instead of some kind of other editor or drag-and-drop GIF maker is because I like to know how big the output GIF is going to be, and have fine-tuning over different things like how fast it runs, what the colors look like, and its end dimensions. If you're in an absolute hurry, sure, you can use one of those services, but you're usually going to have to put up with bad compression, a watermark logo, or something that ultimately looks bad or doesn't fit your needs.

#Step 1: Getting your video

I know I mention video, but that is what we make our GIFs out of. [You can download this video as a sample](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9j78myctwhwjss1/tozawa.mp4?dl=0) from my Dropbox.

Keep in mind that the size of the video matters; Photoshop can only import 500 frames of a video at maximum. When you import the video into Photoshop (in order to do the GIF work) it will tell you that it's either a large video in size and/or in frames. The large size of a video can make it difficult to work with, as changes will need to be applied to the whole thing.

#Step 2: Importing into Photoshop

After opening Photoshop, we can import our video by going to **File > Import > Frames to Layers**.
