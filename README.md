# Matt's tutorial repository

This is a collection of tutorials and information that I've found useful when it comes to esports content production, streaming, and making stuff in general.

By collecting it all in one place, I hope to make it easier to be able to spread the information and have people contribute via Github in order to improve it.

Guides:

* [Making GIFs](https://github.com/MattDemers/tutorials/blob/master/making-gifs.md)
* [Automating Discord with Zapier](https://github.com/MattDemers/tutorials/blob/master/automating-discord.md)
* [Getting IFTTT notifications from Twitter lists](https://github.com/MattDemers/tutorials/blob/master/IFTTT-twitter-lists.md) 

This is by no means a perfect repository, and there are obviously going to be better practices that people have developed further in their own experience. This is just a launching point for people who have no idea otherwise, and hopefully they will seek out more knowledge as they reach the limitations of how far this knowledge goes.
