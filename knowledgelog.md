# Matt Demers' Knowledge database

## Purpose

This is a list of things that Matt Demers has found are useful in content creation, whether it's random software, tutorials, or other things. This will be updated as Matt finds new things to add to it. These things are likely going to be focused on content creation, but will have some notes in terms of how or why they're useful, and categorized appropriately.

## Useful Software/File Management

**[Microsoft Powertoys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)** - Basically a list of small applets that make things on Windows more efficient. I mainly use the [Image Resizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer) in order to batch-resize photos into smaller versions, [PowerRename](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename) to batch-rename files, or [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) to set up regions of my monitors where windows can snap and fill to. Other useful applets are a [Windows-wide colour sampler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) (to find hex codes of things) and having a "Spotlight"-esque dialog/search in [PowerToys Run](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run)

**[Ant Renamer](https://antp.be/software/renamer)** - Great piece of software for batch-renaming files; being able to set up rules and have them run for a folder or something else saves me a ton of time when I'm renaming photos, manga chapters, or other things.

**[Ninite](https://ninite.com/)** - Basically a bulk "install things on a fresh Windows install" program. You check boxes beside the software you want, and it'll give you one program to download that will install all of those things on your PC. It's nice because it'll always install the latest version of the programs, and it'll always choose "no" or "decline" for the adware that are bundled into the installers. Nice to give to relatives or parents who can't really be trusted to install their own software, or who might be a bit intimidated by dialogs.
