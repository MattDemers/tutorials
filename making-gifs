#Making GIFs with Photoshop

Making GIFs is currently becoming one of the most important things in my toolkit, mostly because they make tweets look better and furnish articles well. However, you need to be careful of both size and content in order to meet space requirements, as the file format is inherently large due to its age and poor optimization.

This can be worked around in certain stages, but sadly people haven't phased GIFs out entirely due to a couple reasons (by my thoughts, at least):

1. They auto-play on Twitter instead of requiring a user to click through. They also play on hover for other services (Tumblr, Facebook, etc)
2. They are accepted by many older services, especially ones that don't accept embedding your own HTML (like Pinterest)
3. GIFV, GFYs and .WebMs have yet to come up with a format that works for everyone

It sounds silly, but even putting one button for people to click (like playing a video or .WebM) might be enough for people *not* to click on it. Yes, I realize that's stupid, but that's kind of how content and readers are sometimes.
