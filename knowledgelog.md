# Matt Demers' Knowledge database

## Purpose

This is a list of things that Matt Demers has found are useful in content creation, whether it's random software, tutorials, or other things. This will be updated as Matt finds new things to add to it. These things are likely going to be focused on content creation, but will have some notes in terms of how or why they're useful, and categorized appropriately.

None of these links have trackers or referral codes embedded in them, to the best of my knowledge. Use them at your own risk - I don't provide support myself.

## Useful Software/File Management

|Software|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**[Microsoft Powertoys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)**|Windows Utility| Basically a list of small applets that make things on Windows more efficient. I mainly use the [Image Resizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer) in order to batch-resize photos into smaller versions, [PowerRename](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename) to batch-rename files, or [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) to set up regions of my monitors where windows can snap and fill to. Other useful applets are a [Windows-wide colour sampler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) (to find hex codes of things) and having a "Spotlight"-esque dialog/search in [PowerToys Run](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run)|
|**[Ant Renamer](https://antp.be/software/renamer)**|File Management|Great piece of software for batch-renaming files; being able to set up rules and have them run for a folder or something else saves me a ton of time when I'm renaming photos, manga chapters, or other things.
|**[Ninite](https://ninite.com/)**|Installer|Basically a bulk "install things on a fresh Windows install" program. You check boxes beside the software you want, and it'll give you one program to download that will install all of those things on your PC. It's nice because it'll always install the latest version of the programs, and it'll always choose "no" or "decline" for the adware that are bundled into the installers. Nice to give to relatives or parents who can't really be trusted to install their own software, or who might be a bit intimidated by dialogs.|
|**[MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)**|File Management|Edits metadata for a number of different file formats. I mainly use it for audio (WAV/MP3) to add ID3 tags; this means that when someone imports a podcast episode to iTunes or whatever, it'll have the proper "Artist" or "Title" attributes. Allows for copy-pasting tags, which means I just have to change "Issue #1" to "Issue #2" and save it every time I make a new episode. Works with video as well, but I don't really touch that.|
|**[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)**|Content Production|Open-source, well-maintained, well-supported program for streaming or recording from your computer. Not much else to say because I'd have to write a full tutorial on that, and there's plenty of them available. I prefer this software to StreamLabs OBS (SLOBS) or Xsplit.|
|**[PCGen](http://pcgen.org/)**|Gaming Tool|Open-source character builder for a number of TTRPG systems, like Pathfinder/Starfinder, D&D 3.5 and 5th editions. Ad companies obviously want to be careful of their IP, you won't be able to get the full D&D Beyond experience as the info sources are very basic. However, if you're looking for an alternative and are working off PDFs or paper books (without buying the D&D Beyond equivalent) this might be for you. Also, there are [homebrewed datasets](https://github.com/BahamutDragon/pcgen) of books not officially supported by the devs.|
|**[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)**|Ebooks|Juggernaut ebook/e-reader device manager. Does everything I need to import CBRs/CBZs to my e-reader, even though it's aging. Has the ability to download ebook metadata and covers from Amazon/other stores if you have an ISBN. Requires some plugin/driver work for specific e-readers like Kobo Touch ([1](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=215339)), ([2](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=211135)).|
|[Da Vinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)   |Video Editor   |Powerful video editor with a free edition. Does a lot of the things someone would normally pirate Adobe Premiere for, without the legal complications of piracy. Not open-source, and you have to register an account to use it. Might get hounded to upgrade to a Premium product, but hey, it's the price you pay. |
|[Brave Browser ](https://brave.com/)  | Web Browser |Google Chrome, but not. Privacy-focused. Has [an interesting model of supporting creators](https://rentry.co/mattbat2) through generating cryptocurrency through privacy-respecting ads. I'm obviously biased because I earn $BAT, but it's a good alternative to Chrome due to removing all the Google data harvesting bits while maintaining compatibility with all Google Chrome Extensions.|
|[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)   | Web Browser   | Same as above, but for Firefox (with regards to the extension compatibility). A bit more hardline on privacy and privacy features (for instance, by default it's going to clear cookies and data for you unless you set up exceptions). Community project, but I use it as a secondary (or "work") browser.|


## Web Services/Proxies

|Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|[Nitter](https://Nitter.net)|Social Media Proxy|Javascript and adless version of Twitter that loads quickly and doesn't require sign-in to view someone's timeline. However, can't post from it, and can't do things like liking or retweeting. Can combine multiple feeds together by adding commas (example: `https://nitter.net/MattDemers,default_friend`). Default Nitter goes down often, so you can find [a list of other instances here](https://github.com/xnaas/nitter-instances). They're just other installs of Nitter's software on other infrastructure, and work the same way.|
|[ProxiTok](https://proxitok.herokuapp.com/)|Social Media Proxy   |Same as Nitter, but only for TikTok. List of public instances can be found [here](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok/wiki/Public-instances). Has "Discover" and "Trending" buttons for finding new things.|
|Bibliogram|Social Media Proxy|Same as above, only for Instagram. A bit tempermental compared to the above two, [since Instagram seems to really hate the project](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/cadence.moe/gemlog/2020-12-17-future-of-bibliogram.bliz). If you can find [a good instance](https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram-docs/tree/master/docs/Instances.md), you can view Instagram pages without needing to log in.|
|[FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/)|Content Proxy|Ad-free and private frontend for YouTube. Doesn't sync with your subscriptions list - pretty much have to follow channels separately and then export/import them to new FreeTube installs. Supports importing playlists, but not saving them. Basically copy-paste in YouTube links or Playlist links into its search to play. Make sure to support creators in other ways (Patreon, Donations, Ko-Fi) if you aren't going to watch their ads.]
|[Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/)|Content Proxy|Uses VLC to play Twitch streams. Is a command-line interface, so you're going to have to learn how to open a command prompt and type `streamlink https://twitch.tv/mattdemers best` yourself. Make sure to support creators in other ways (Patreon, Donations, Ko-Fi) if you aren't going to watch their ads.|
|[Streamlink Twitch GUI](https://streamlink.github.io/streamlink-twitch-gui/)|Content Proxy|Syncs your followed channels and allows for browsing/search for Streamlink. Need to install Streamlink first.|
|[Hephaistos](https://hephaistos.azurewebsites.net/)| TTRPG Tool  |Character builder (essentially, D&D Beyond) for Starfinder 1E. Developed by one guy. Support [his Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=44481570) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hephaistos).|
|[MiraHeze](https://Miraheze.org) |Free Wiki Hosting   |Free MediaWiki hosting for projects of all sizes. Very helpful staff. Kind of going to be at their mercy for infrastructure (sometimes things are slow, and you'll need staff to upload certain things bigger than certain sizes). You get what you pay for. No ads, which helps small projects.  |
|[NameChk](https://Namechk.com)   |Username auditor   |Allows for fast checking of available usernames across a lot of different web services. Useful if you're looking to establish a new brand for yourself and want to check a bunch of username possibilities at once.   |
|[Signal](https://signal.org/)   |Messenger   |Yeah yeah, it's going to be hard to get your friends off WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram DMs, Telegram or iMessage. All I can say is that Signal is the real deal when it comes to private messaging. They don't (and *can't*) see any of your messages or attachments (that means nudes, horndogs), so I really advocate for what they're doing. I've gotten a lot of my network on there, and people have started suggesting it to *me*, too. Lags a little behind the flashy features of WhatsApp and Telegram (and doesn't have a username registration yet; you need a phone number), but hey, I just want something I can use with peace of mind, and something that has a desktop version. |
|[Proton Mail, Calendar, VPN, Drive](https://proton.me/)   | Web Suite  | Have been proud to [pay for](https://proton.me/pricing) Proton's suite of services as an effort to de-Google myself. Probably the best alternative to Gmail/GApps in terms of user-friendliness; paying gets you a lot of extra features, like alternative email aliases that forward to your main inbox. Private, based in Switzerland. |

## Bots and self-installs
|Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|[Matomo](https://matomo.org/)   | Analytics service  |Google Analytics, only you own the data. Need to be familiar with Docker (ie, have your own server solution) to make it work, but hey, it's one more step to de-Googling. Works pretty similar.   |
|[PhantomBot](https://phantombot.github.io/)   | Twitch/Discord Bot  | Have been using PhantomBot for a couple years now; it's lived on my Raspberry Pi and has taught me a lot about a number of things (Unix, Linux, Python, etc). Basically I wanted a bot that could have its own username, custom commands, timers, and other things without having to pay for it. Discord support can be a bit surly, but I like the project. |
|[MonitoRSS](https://monitorss.xyz/)   | Discord Bot  | I needed a solution that would read an RSS feed (like, for when I posted something new [on my site](https://mattdemers.com), [PlusHeart](https://plusheart.substack.com), or [my YouTube](https://youtube.com/mattdemers)) and alert my Discord when it was updated. I like this bot because it's pretty low-key and the ability to customize the embed works really well. Might move this functionality to Red if I can, but for now it works.  |
|[Red Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)   | Discord Bot  | Open-source Discord bot with "cogs" that are community-developed. [Bit difficult to set up](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot#installation), but nice if you're looking for a challenge, or something to live on a Raspberry Pi.  |


## Graphic Design Resources

|Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|[Vertex.im](https://Vertex.im)   |Free Icons  | 3D icons for use in different places; you set the rotation/placement and material/light options (ie, changing glass to frosted glass) and then download the result as a PNG.|
|[TransparentTextures](https://TransparentTextures.com)| Free Textures  | Use these textures in Photoshop by opening them and then going to `Edit > Define Pattern`. Then you can use them in the Pattern Overlay menu in the Blending Options for a layer. Has a few brand logos. "Free for commercial and personal use", but no license on the site. **Note: Search doesn't work with capitals for some reason**. |
|[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)   |Free\* Icons (+ Attribution)  | I found FontAwesome as a good way to get icons that scale infinitely (since you can download their fontset locally for use in Photoshop) or to install on my site. I say "Free\*" because [you don't get access to all their icons](https://fontawesome.com/support#why-do-i-have-to-pay-for-font-awesome-icons-now), but there's enough brand stuff in there (logos) that are useful for what I need. Requires attribution.|
|[Pexels](https://Pexels.com)   |Free/Public Domain Photos   | [Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (ie, fine to use with no attribution, and for commercial projects) photography. Really decent database, and doesn't require a login or anything to download. Say thanks to your photographers, though.  |
|[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)   |Free/Public Domain Photos  |Similar to above.|
|[Reshot](https://Reshot.com)  |Free Graphics  | Same as above, only for icons and some corporate art. Really useful to be able to download the SVG and edit with Illustrator. [License is here, but permissive](https://www.reshot.com/license/). |
|[TheFutur's "Content"](https://thefutur.com/learn)|Tutorials/Classes | I haven't bought any of TheFutur's courses or templates, but I've found that their site has a "Content" tab that has a lot of good courses/resources for learning marketing skills.  |
