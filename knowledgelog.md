# Matt Demers' Knowledge database

## Purpose

This is a list of things that Matt Demers has found are useful in content creation, whether it's random software, tutorials, or other things. This will be updated as Matt finds new things to add to it. These things are likely going to be focused on content creation, but will have some notes in terms of how or why they're useful, and categorized appropriately.

## Useful Software/File Management

|Software|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**[Microsoft Powertoys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)**|Windows Utility| Basically a list of small applets that make things on Windows more efficient. I mainly use the [Image Resizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer) in order to batch-resize photos into smaller versions, [PowerRename](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename) to batch-rename files, or [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) to set up regions of my monitors where windows can snap and fill to. Other useful applets are a [Windows-wide colour sampler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) (to find hex codes of things) and having a "Spotlight"-esque dialog/search in [PowerToys Run](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run)|
|**[Ant Renamer](https://antp.be/software/renamer)**|File Management|Great piece of software for batch-renaming files; being able to set up rules and have them run for a folder or something else saves me a ton of time when I'm renaming photos, manga chapters, or other things.
|**[Ninite](https://ninite.com/)**|Installer|Basically a bulk "install things on a fresh Windows install" program. You check boxes beside the software you want, and it'll give you one program to download that will install all of those things on your PC. It's nice because it'll always install the latest version of the programs, and it'll always choose "no" or "decline" for the adware that are bundled into the installers. Nice to give to relatives or parents who can't really be trusted to install their own software, or who might be a bit intimidated by dialogs.|
|**[MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)**|File Management|Edits metadata for a number of different file formats. I mainly use it for audio (WAV/MP3) to add ID3 tags; this means that when someone imports a podcast episode to iTunes or whatever, it'll have the proper "Artist" or "Title" attributes. Allows for copy-pasting tags, which means I just have to change "Issue #1" to "Issue #2" and save it every time I make a new episode. Works with video as well, but I don't really touch that.|
|**[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)**|Content Production|Open-source, well-maintained, well-supported program for streaming or recording from your computer. Not much else to say because I'd have to write a full tutorial on that, and there's plenty of them available. I prefer this software to StreamLabs OBS (SLOBS) or Xsplit.|
|**[PCGen](http://pcgen.org/)**|Gaming Tool|Open-sourced character builder for a number of TTRPG systems, like Pathfinder/Starfinder, D&D 3.5 and 5th editions. Ad companies obviously want to be careful of their IP, you won't be able to get the full D&D Beyond experience as the info sources are very basic. However, if you're looking for an alternative and are working off PDFs or paper books (without buying the D&D Beyond equivalent) this might be for you. Also, there are [homebrewed datasets](https://github.com/BahamutDragon/pcgen) of books not officially supported by the devs.|
|**[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)**|Ebooks|Juggernaut ebook/ereader device manager. Does everything I need to import CBRs/CBZs to my ereader, even though it's aging. Has the ability to download ebook metadata and covers from Amazon/other stores if you have an ISBN. Requires some plugin/driver work for specific ereaders like Kobo Touch ([1](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=215339)), ([2](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=211135)).|
